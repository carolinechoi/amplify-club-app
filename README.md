# Applify by amplify
"The art of communication is the language of leadership."

In 2017 I started an environment conservation club called ‘Amplify’. The challenges? One, getting club members to attend events. Two, allowing students to access club information faster and easier. 

The vision was to build a clean and simple app that contained solutions to these issues. Ultimately, we desired an increase in club engagement and a decrease in apathy.

Built on Ionic (v.4) using Google Firebase Realtime Database and Auth.
